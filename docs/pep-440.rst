PEP-440 Compliance changes
==========================

``setupmeta`` v2.9.1 corrects yielded versions so they are PEP-440 compliant.

This does change how yielded versions look like,
especially if you use complex ones like ``build-id``.

What remains unchanged
======================

The "main part" of your version will remain unchanged for all strategies except ``devcommit``.


What's changed
==============

* ``devcommit``: ``.dev`` will NOT be alone anymore, but will yield a number indicating
  the number of commits since last tag: ``.devN``).

* ``build-id`` and any strategy that wants to show the "commit id":
  the "local" part of your version will now **always** be shown

* ``separator`` advanced argument is retired (you'll get a deprecation warning if you specify it)

* Any separator other than ``"+"`` will generate a deprecation warning
