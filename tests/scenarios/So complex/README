My cplx-nm_here - Sample complex project

README is a regular txt file
.. [[include HISTORY.txt]]
Done with README.
.. [[end long_description]]

Everything below will not make it to long_description

No README.rst here, long description is still found in this "README" however

Other peculiarities of this example:
- only part of this README is included, as well as part of HISTORY.txt
- there's a package in complex/ as well as src/complex/
- `version` is defined 3 times
- `keywords` is defined everywhere, the setup.py docstring (first found) wins
- there's an `author`, `contact`, and `maintainer`
- `maintainer` is defined twice
- `url` is auto-filled with package name
- `download_url` is auto-filled from a relative path
- there's an explicit `extras_require`
- `classifiers` is mention explicitly, as well as in `classifiers.txt` file
- there's an `entry_points.ini`
- there's a `pinned.txt` and `requirements-dev.txt`
